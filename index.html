      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, My name is Doug</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>St. Louis MO.  moved to Seattle in 2005 for a job with T-Mobile.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I used to spend a lot of time playing the drums and checking out music in general, but not so much these days.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I was asked that question in an interview 10+ years ago at AT&T.  I told them my dream job would be to play drums with Led Zeppelin or 'Earth, Wind, and Fire'.  got some good laughs from that one.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Shoreline</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I was really bored with my current job and my skillset is quickly becoming obsolete.</p>
